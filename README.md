# NeuralNetwork
didactic implementation of neural networks, starting from numpy only

## introduction
Simple and didactic implementation of a dense feedforward neural network.
The goal is to make something that feels a bit like (the most simple user case of) keras, starting from numpy only 
(not using any machine learning packages), in order to further demystify neural networks 
and to prove that their basic operation is not so extremely difficult to grasp and implement... 

## structure
- the core class definitions for building a neural network are grouped in the src folder
- the diag folder contains classes to help with diagnostics of the network during and after training
- some simple tools for preprocessing the training/test data are in the preprocessing folder
- the datagen folder contains simple data generation tools for early testing
- the test folder contains scripts for testing the classes and functions

## note
Still in very early stage...
But test/test_Network_2.py contains a working example as proof of principle.
